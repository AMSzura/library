# library

Begun as an assigned project within The Odin Project's javascript course, the spec being to create a basic site
capabable of displaying a library of user submitted books.

Once the spec had been met I decided out of interest to continue to flesh out the application, adding
a more robust user interface, improving styling, as well as methods to sort the books and corresponding UI.

The next steps include: add search functionality, stagger the incoming animation on the cards, and add a basic local storage system.
The site will also be made more responsive and accessible, and the code will finally be refactored to better standards of OOP.

The app currently contains a set of books for test purposes, that can be temporarily added to by the user.
