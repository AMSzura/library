# library

Begun as an assigned project within The Odin Project's javascript course, the spec being to create a basic site
capabable of displaying a library of user submitted books.

Once the spec had been met I decided out of interest to continue to flesh out the application, adding
a more robust user interface as well as methods to sort the books with corresponding UI.

The next steps include: add search functionality, stagger the incoming animation on the cards, and add a basic local storage system.

I also plan to integrate Google Books API, so that users can 'import' books from it to their library.

The site will also be made more responsive and accessible.

The app currently contains a set of books for test purposes, that can be temporarily added to by the user.
